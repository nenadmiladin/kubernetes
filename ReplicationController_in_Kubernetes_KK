The Nautilus DevOps team wants to create a ReplicationController to deploy several pods. 

They are going to deploy applications on these pods, which need some highly available infrastructure. 

Below you can find exact details, and please create the ReplicationController accordingly.

Create a ReplicationController using httpd image, preferably with latest tag, and name it as httpd-replicationcontroller.

Labels app should be httpd_app, and labels type should be front-end. The container should be named as httpd-container and also make sure replica counts are 3.

All pods should be running state.
